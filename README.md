# Visual-Argument-Project

## Description:

The aim of this visual argument is to convince people to prioritize the usage of solar panels over other means of generating electricity. This visual takes the form of a campaign poster or billboard. The main audience and use case for this image is to politically active Americans and politicans, especially those in Congress. The goal is to demonstrate how simple it would be to power the entirity of the United States, but comparing the size of the USA to the state of West Virginia. West Virginia has an area of about 24,000 square miles, where onlyy 22,000 square miles of solar panels would be necessary to power the entire United States on their own. I am applying this fact to visually emphasize how large the United States is in comparison to that area of solar panels. Also, I chose to use a nighttime satelite image of the USA to emphasize the use of electricity across America. Rather than focus on the issues of climate change, my visual argument focuses on a specific potential solution. This concept is inspired in part by the International Soalr Allience, which aims to create a world-wide electricity grid based on solar energy. I have also seen other examples of how desert area can be used to make solar farms large enough to power the entirity of Europe, which inspired me in my visual argument. To emphasize that this image relates to solar panels and solar energy, I made the main text of the image "Thats all it takes" be made out of images of solar panels. Also, to make the area of West Virginia more visable, I added a yello aura around it which also further emphasizes the ideas of solar energy and light.
